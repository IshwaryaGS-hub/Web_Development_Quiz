##  How It Works
1. DOM-based rendering

Questions, options, and score are created dynamically using JavaScript.

2. 180-second countdown

A built-in timer:

let timeLeft = 180 ;


If timer reaches 0 → quiz auto-submits.

3. Real-time updates

When a question is answered, DOM elements update instantly without reload.
